- 👋 Hi, I’m @BDitto, A Queer, Dyslexic, ADHD coder from the UK
- 👀 I’m interested in just about anything LGBT and Videogames wise 
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning python (I got rusty) and Google Data Studio 
- 💞️ I’m not actively looking to collaborate on anything right now however LGBT+ and Disability focused projects are most likely to catch my eye.
<!--- - 📫 To reach me DM's are always good :) --->
